# DEPRECATED - Angular 2 Firebase Tools Demo

## Use this instead!

There is an official Angular 2 <-> Firebase library now (as of 2017) in fine
condition for real use, implemented by the team at Firebase / Google:

https://github.com/angular/angularfire2

You should probably use that library. It certainly has more documentation
and features than this one.

Therefore, this repository remains solely as a historical artifact.

# Angular2 Firebase Demo (old)

This sample application demonstrates use of the angular2-firebase package.
It is based on:

* Angular 2
* angular2-firebase (unoffical Angular 2 - Firebase library)
* Observables (from RxJS 5, via Angular 2)
* Firebase
* Webpack

To run the demo locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```

See the comments in the TS files for an explanation of what is going on here.

TODO explain how to use a different firebase DB.

## Deployment Notes

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase deploy
```
